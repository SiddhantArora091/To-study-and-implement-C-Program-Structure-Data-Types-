# Experiment 2: Data Types and Their Sizes in C++

## üìò Theory

In C++, different data types are used to store different kinds of data such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and boolean values. Each data type occupies a specific amount of memory (measured in bytes) depending on the system architecture and compiler.

This experiment demonstrates:
- How to declare variables of various fundamental data types.
- How to input values from the user.
- How to find the size of each data type using the `sizeof()` operator.

Understanding the size of data types is crucial for optimizing memory usage and ensuring program efficiency.

## üîç Overview

This program prompts the user to input values for different data types:

- Integer (`int`)
- Floating-point number (`float`)
- Double precision floating-point number (`double`)
- String (`string`)
- Character (`char`)
- Boolean (`bool`)

For each input, it displays the value entered and the size (in bytes) occupied by the corresponding data type on the system.

## üí° Concept

### Key Concepts Covered:

- **Data Types in C++**: `int`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `char`, `bool`
- **User Input**: Using `cin` to accept values from the user
- **Sizeof Operator**: `sizeof()` returns the size in bytes of the data type or variable
- **Basic I/O**: Displaying information with `cout`

## üéØ Purpose

### Purpose 1  
To familiarize students with basic C++ data types and how they are represented in memory.

### Purpose 2  
To learn how to take input from the user and display both the value and the size of each data type, which is essential for understanding memory allocation and efficient programming.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This experiment provides practical insight into how various fundamental data types are handled in C++. By knowing the size of each type, programmers can write more memory-efficient code and avoid potential pitfalls related to data storage. This foundational knowledge is critical as students advance to more complex programming topics.
